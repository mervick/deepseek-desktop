## ✨ Why Gemini Desktop

- **Desktop-native workflow**: Use Gemini in a dedicated app window instead of a browser tab.
- **Fast keyboard control**: Trigger Quick Chat, hide/restore the app, and stay in flow.
- **Trust-first defaults**: No telemetry, Google auth, and clear transparency/security docs.

## 🌟 Feature Highlights

- **Multi-tab conversations** — keep multiple chat contexts open and switch instantly.
- **Launch at startup** — optionally start with your system and open minimized.
- **Quick Chat** — summon a Spotlight-style prompt from anywhere with a global hotkey.
- **Peek and Hide** — hide to tray and restore instantly when you need it.
- **Response notifications** — get notified when Gemini finishes while the app is unfocused.
- **Always On Top** — keep Gemini visible above other windows when multitasking.
